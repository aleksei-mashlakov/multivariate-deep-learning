## Data

Due to the requirements of the cooperative enterprise, the dataset we used in this paper cannot be available temporarily.

You can try other multivariate time series datasets in this way:

1. Download the dataset in .txt file.
2. Split the dataset into training, validation and test set.
3. Name the three files `{data_name}_train.txt`, `{data_name}_validation.txt`, `{data_name}_test.txt`.
4. Place the three files in `./data/{data_name}` by default.

The data organization in the .txt file is the same as that in [laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data](https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data).
